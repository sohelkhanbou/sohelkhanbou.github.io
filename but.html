Getting started with PyScript
This page will guide you through getting started with PyScript.

Development setup
PyScript does not require any development environment other than a web browser. We recommend using Chrome.

If you're using VSCode the Live Server extension can be used to reload the page as you edit the HTML file.

Installation
There is no installation required. In this document we'll use the PyScript assets served on https://pyscript.net.

If you want to download the source and build it yourself follow the instructions in the README.md file.

Your first PyScript HTML file
Here's a "Hello, world!" example using PyScript

Using your favorite editor create a new file called hello.html in the same directory as your PyScript JavaScript and CSS files with the following content and open the file in your web browser. You can typically open an HTML by double clicking it in your file explorer.

<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
    <script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body> <py-script> print('Hello, World!') </py-script> </body>
</html>
Notice the use of the <py-script> tag in the HTML body. This is where you'll write your Python code. In the following sections we'll introduce the 8 tags provided by PyScript.

The py-script tag
The <py-script> tag let's you execute multi-line Python scripts and print back onto the page. For example, we can compute π.

<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
    <script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
      <py-script>
print("Let's compute π:")
def wallis(n):
    pi = 2
    for i in range(1,n):
        pi *= 4 * i ** 2 / (4 * i ** 2 - 1)
    return pi

pi = wallis(100000)
s = f"π is approximately {pi:.3f}"
print(s)
      </py-script>
  </body>
</html>
